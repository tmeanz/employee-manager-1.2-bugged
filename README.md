# Project Summary

In this project we are building a front end for an employee management system.  It should run on any modern browser (post I.E. 8 and similar), and be fully functional, and reasonably styled.  Chrome will be our recommended browser.

## Current Desired Functionality

The application will load a simulated list of employees, and allow modifications to each.  Clicking the employee from the list to the side will bring their file up in the editor.  Your employee will consist of:

* ID        (Whole, positive, and unique number)
* Name      (1-30 characters long)
* Phone     (10 digits in length)
* Title     (1-30 characters long)

All fields except for ID are editable.  When saving a change, it will persist as you access other records and navigate back to the desired employee.  The save and cancel buttons will only be accessible when modifications have been made, and the cancel button will revert the employee's file back to the most recently saved version.  Every editable field must be populated to save.

## Change Log for Version 1.1

* Added error messages for incorrect inputs
* The invalid field is underlined in red
* Fields cannot be saved while invalid

## Future Functionality

To be aware of, but not currently implemented

* Phone numbers will be validated 10 digit, area code included, US phone numbers.
* The Employee List will reside in a database and be accessed through API integration
* An Add Employee function will be implemented
* A search function to filter the employee list will be available, based on Job Title, Name, and/or ID
* An Email Address field will be added for each employee file
* All fields will be required for any entry/modification

## Disclosure
